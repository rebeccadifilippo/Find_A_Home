## 🚀 About the Project

**Find a Home** is a response to the "information overload" and "cluttered interfaces" prevalent in current real estate tools (like Realtor.ca).

Through our **User Requirements Elicitation** process, we identified that first-time buyers (Primary Persona: "Jenny Yu") often feel overwhelmed by "walls of text," confusing filters, and the inability to easily compare properties without opening dozens of tabs. Our application addresses these pain points by prioritizing visual clarity, simplified filtering, and intuitive navigation on both mobile and desktop.

## ✨ Key Features

Based on our **Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)** and **Functional Requirements**, this application implements:

* **Swipe-to-Browse:** An intuitive, Tinder-style swipe interface to quickly save or discard listings, reducing decision fatigue and navigation time.
* **Smart Comparison:** Specific tools to compare 2+ listings side-by-side without opening multiple browser tabs.
* **Streamlined Filtering:** Essential filters (Location, Price, Rooms) are prioritized to prevent the "filter paralysis" observed in our user studies.
* **Visual Clarity:** Listings use icons and bullet points rather than dense paragraphs to improve readability (solving the "Wall of Text" issue).
* **Direct Messaging:** Integrated in-app messaging to contact realtors without filling out external forms or fearing spam.

## 🧠 User Research & Rationale

Our design is grounded in extensive user research involving:

1.  **Semi-Structured Interviews:** We interviewed recent homebuyers and discovered a strong aversion to visual clutter and a desire for better saving mechanisms.
2.  **Observational Studies:** We watched users interact with existing platforms and noted that **mobile users** struggled significantly with navigation and saving flows.
